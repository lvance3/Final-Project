# Final-Project
final project for advanced programming

The program will rad every .pdb file within a selected folder and calculate the relative energies of each model using pairwise interactions with a user determined distance threshold.

The output.txt file will apear within the location the program itself is located in.

The program supports multithreading with up to around 8x speedup on my machine at 12 threads.
